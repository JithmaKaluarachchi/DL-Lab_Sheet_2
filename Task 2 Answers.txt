1.   What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?

      The model capacity increases: more hidden nodes let the network represent more complex decision boundaries. Small numbers of nodes may underfit (cannot separate classes), while more nodes let the model fit more complex patterns.

2.   Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?

     * With very few nodes the model underfits → low accuracy.

     * As nodes increase, accuracy usually rises (the model can express the required function).

     * After some point accuracy plateaus (additional nodes do not help) or fluctuates due to random initialization/training.

     * Very large hidden layers can cause overfitting (high training accuracy but worse generalization) and slower training.

     * Because of randomness, accuracy may not strictly increase monotically — rerun each size a few times or average results for a reliable pattern.
